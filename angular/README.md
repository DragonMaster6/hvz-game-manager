# Human vs. Zombies Game Manager

The purpose of this project is to help me learn the ins and outs of AngularJS. To further this, I decided to decouple the Drupal CMS to practice constructing APIs and determine if AngularJS is a good framework to build a multipage website.

From what I've found out, AngularJs can utilize multipage views


##Purpose:
This project is intended to help keep track of scores when playing the popular college campus game Humans vs. Zombies (More info here [Humans vs. Zombies][hvzorg]). Briefly, this tag based game consists of two teams: Humans whose goal is to stay human the entirety of the game and zombies whose goal is to infect all the humans. To infect a human, a zombie must tag said human and return that human's game id (usually on paper) to the game managers. To make the game more manageable to provide players with statistics easily each game, this project aims to count the number of tags a zombie has, which human survived the longest, and a lot more features.

On the side, this project also serves as a learning tool. Currently I'm learning the ins and outs of AngularJs and integrating front-end features with Drupal, a CMS serving as a backend framework for this project.
